I developed MEGAN, a sophisticated AI assistant designed to automate daily tasks and enhance user interaction through voice commands. This intelligent system utilizes natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand user instructions, control smart home devices, manage schedules, and provide real-time information. With features like voice recognition, data retrieval, and task automation, Jarvis adapts to user preferences, making everyday life more convenient and efficient. My goal was to create a seamless interface that blends advanced technology with practical functionality, ultimately transforming the way users interact with their environment.
